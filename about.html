            <h2>About the Company that Made This Game - Namco</h2>
            <p>Namco, which is short for "Nakamura Manufacturing Company," was founded in Tokyo, Japan in 1955 by Masaya Nakamura. Initially, the company started as a manufacturer of amusement park rides and later moved into producing arcade games in the 1970s.</p>
            <p>In 1979, Namco released the game Galaxian, which was a space shooter game that became quite popular in Japan. The following year, Namco released Galaga, which was a sequel to Galaxian and became even more popular than its predecessor. Galaga featured improved graphics and gameplay mechanics, and it is still regarded as one of the most beloved classic arcade games of all time.</p>
            <p>Namco continued to produce a variety of popular arcade games throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Ridge Racer. In 2005, Namco merged with Bandai to become Bandai Namco Holdings, which is still one of the largest video game publishers in the world today.</p>
            <p>In North America, Galaga was published by Midway Games, which was a prominent arcade game publisher and distributor during the 1980s and 1990s. Midway Games was responsible for publishing many popular arcade games in North America, including Mortal Kombat, NBA Jam, and Rampage. However, Midway Games filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and was dissolved in 2010, and its assets were acquired by other companies.</p>
