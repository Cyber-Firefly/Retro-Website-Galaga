                <ul>
                    <li>Gameplay: Galaga is a vertical-scrolling shooter game, where the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving it left or right, and shooting at enemy alien ships that appear on the screen. The objective is to score as many points as possible by shooting down the enemy ships.</li>
                    <li>Enemies: The enemies in Galaga come in various shapes and sizes, with different attack patterns and speeds. There are also boss ships that appear periodically throughout the game.</li>
                    <li>Power-ups: The game features power-ups that can be collected by shooting certain enemy ships. These power-ups include a double shot, a tractor beam that captures the player's ship and adds it to the enemy formation, and a shield that provides temporary invincibility.
                    </li>
                    <li>Challenging stages: Every few levels, there is a challenging stage where the player must shoot down as many enemy ships as possible to score bonus points.
